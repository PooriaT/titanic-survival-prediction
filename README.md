# Titanic Survival Prediction
It is a Random Forest Classification modeling to predict survival on the Titanic


On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

## Problem Definition
The main question is that "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?" Thus, based on the inforamtion in the data, we should predict the who can survive and who cannot. As the desired output is two things, we are faced with binary classification.
